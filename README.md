📊 Clear Connect Communication Analysis

🧾 **Project Overview**
This project analyzes customer interactions from Clear Connect Communication to identify performance gaps, customer satisfaction drivers, and opportunities for improving response and resolution times.
The analysis covers metrics such as Total Calls, CSAT (Customer Satisfaction), AHT (Average Handling Time), SLA (Service Level Agreement), and breakdowns by channel, state, and issue type.

**Call Center Cleaned.xlsx**:The main Excel workbook containing multiple worksheets:
• Cleaned Dataset – data cleaning and formatting steps.
• EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) – pivot tables, calculated fields, and summary tables.
• Dashboard – visual dashboards showing KPIs (CSAT, SLA, AHT, Total Calls) and insights by channel, state, and call center.

**Project Charter.docx**: Defines the project objectives, milestones, and deliverables. It also explains the purpose of the analysis and expected business outcomes.

**Final Project Report.docx**: A summary report that compiles all key insights, interpretations, and recommendations derived from the data analysis and dashboards.


📈 **Key Insights**
